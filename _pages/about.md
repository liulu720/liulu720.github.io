<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student majoring in Transportation Engineering  at [the College of Transportation, Tongji University](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professors Xiong Xi, Xie Chi and Ou Dongxiu. 

My research interests include intelligent connected transportation systems, multi-agent collaboration, reinforcement learning, model predictive control, etc.
