<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Engineering at [the College of Transportation, Tongji University](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/), where I work under the supervision of [Dr. Xiong Xi (Research Professor)]([https://xiong-xi.com/](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2996/9880.htm), [Prof. Xie Chi](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2996/9470.htm), and [Prof. Ou Dongxiu](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/info/2996/9479.htm). 

My research focuses on connected and automated transportation systems, multi-agent coordination, reinforcement learning, model predictive control, etc.
